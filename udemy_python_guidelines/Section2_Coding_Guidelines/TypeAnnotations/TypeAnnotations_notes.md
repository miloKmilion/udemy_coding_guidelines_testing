# Type Annotations

Type annotations are a must in any programming task.

It can be defined like a docstring just for the reader of the code and some tools that scan the code before execution.

MyPy is a toll that takes the code and scan it for potential issues. So the code runs smoothly by checking that the inputs and outputs are the ones required by the function.
