# RUff

Will replace Flake8 and Pylint, since is one of the fastest tool available.
Implemented in RUST increases the speed of analysis while covering extra checks.

In the future isort functionalities will be covered in the tool.

command:

It can be only for one specific python file.

```bash
ruff check .
```

## Configuration

Inside the pyproject.toml -->

```python
[tool.ruff]
# Decrease the max line length to 79 characters.
line-length = 79

select = [
    "E", # Pycodestyle
    "F", # Pyflakes
    "UP", # Pyupgrade
    "D", # Pydocstyle
]
```

## Ruff Formatter

Is a direct and faster alternative to Black. By default, when creating the ```Generate python config files.``` in the command pallette will create automatically config files.

There is a 99% compatibility between black and ruff. However, in the comma trailling there are differences in how the new space is generated.
