# Python Linters

## Flake8

It is a collection of checks that will be enforced by the PEP8 coding style.
It is not really a tool that find bugs in the code itself. But evaluates if there are deviations to the rules.

## Pylint

It is an static code analyzer. Check for errors, and enforces code standards, the issue is that is slow in comarison with Flake8.

The pyproject.toml file can keep all the configurations for each of the tools without havingt to define individual
configuration files.
